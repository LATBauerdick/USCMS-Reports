Phase 2 Upgrade R&D: April - June 2015

During the third quarter of FY2015, the HL-LHC (Phase 2) endcap calorimetry downselect decision was made by the CMS collaboration.  To cover the pseudorapidity region from 1.5 to 3.0, the high granularity electromagnetic (HGCal) plus the hadronic (FH and BH) calorimeter system was selected.  As outlined in the CMS Technical Proposal (LHCC-P-008) the HGCal incorporates a silicon/tungsten sampling electromagnetic section followed by two hadronic sections: a front one, FH, with silicon sensors and a back one, BH, using plastic scintillator, each with brass absorber.  For the endcap region, this design should provide excellent calorimetry in a very challenging environment of high pileup and substantial radiation exposure.  The US groups play strong roles in this R&D and will contribute key facets of the construction.  As a result of the decision, the operations program subsequently provided additional R&D funds to the principal US groups, UCSB, Minnesota, FNAL, and Maryland, and to the CERN Team Account, for the remainder of 2015.  

The other electromagnetic calorimetry technology previously under consideration, the Shashlik design, will not be considered further for the HL-LHC upgrade.  Nevertheless, at the time of the downselect, the collaboration strongly endorsed an appropriate close out of Shashlik R&D so that key elements of the design could be evaluated and the results published.  After discussing the close out plan with the Shashlik leaders, US CMS provided some additional funding for this effort to the four main groups, Notre Dame, Virginia, CalTech, and Iowa. 
  
Also during this period, the US CMS L1 project manager for Phase 2, Vivian Oâ€™Dell (FNAL), appointed L2 managers.  For the large tracker project, including the forward pixels, outer tracker, and track trigger, Karl Ecklund (Rice) and Chris Hill (OSU) will serve as joint L2s.  Jeremy Mans (Minnesota) is the L2 for endcap calorimetry, Colin Jessop (Notre Dame) is L2 for barrel calorimetry, along with Alexei Safonov (Texas A&M) for the muon systems, and Jeff Berryhill (FNAL) for the trigger system.  The L2 for DAQ is to be named.  Anders Ryd (Cornell) serves as deputy project manager for the upgrade.
