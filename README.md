# USCMS-Reports

These are the quarterly reports for the U.S. CMS Operations Program. 

To create the pdf output just run `make` in the quarterly sub-trees. 

You will need to have [pandoc](http://pandoc.org) and latex installed.

To get pandoc on the mac, the easiest is to use [homebrew](http://brew.sh) to install it. This is really trivial, there's a one-liner on the homebrew web page to get homebrew installed, then you are ready to install packages like pandoc:

 > brew install pandoc

that's it!

On the mac you get the full Latex installation from [MacTEX](https://tug.org/mactex/). 

I'm currently using the font family Minion Pro, which can be easily installed in the mac system (it e.g. comes with the Adobe Reader App for free). If you don't have it and don't want to install it, just choose another font in the template.tex file.
