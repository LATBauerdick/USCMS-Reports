# Program Manager's Summary

During this quarter, the first quarter of  **calendar year 2016** (2016Q1), the LHC and CMS were in an extended "year end technical stop" (YETS).  CMS used the machine downtime to make repairs and enhancements to various elements of the detector.

Important and extensive work was done to clean the "cold box" used to refrigerate and liquefy Helium gas to cool the CMS superconductor solenoid magnet. The oil separator unit on the surface was replaced with a new one that has much higher capacity. The helium transfer line was replaced, and the whole cold box system was cleaned with solvents and all filters were replaced. Analysis of the cleaning solvent showed that significant amounts of BREOX oil had accumulated in the system, that have now been successfully removed. The magnet is being cooled down for operations during the startup of the LHC machine in April.

Repairs of CMS systems, in particular leaks in the EMU cooling systems, are described at some detail in the detector operations section. To keep systems running and commissioned, during the technical stop CMS ran a campaign of so-called global runs with cosmic rays that allowed the commissioning of the detector to proceed without beam.  

Software and Computing was busy with supporting data analysis, and preparing systems for the expected extensive run.  The Tier-1 and Tier-2 facilities met their performance metrics, while also undergoing upgrades and enhancements that will improve their throughput.  The Fermilab computing facility did a significant upgrade of the storage systems.  The operations teams closed out processing of 2015 data and delivered large numbers of simulated events. 

A particular highlight was the successful demonstrator use of the Amazon cloud computing service aws for production running, supported in part by a grant from amazon.com, to deliver large simulation samples in time for use in results presented at winter conferences. The Fermilab Scientific Computing Division started the HEPcloud project, in collaboration with CMS and OSG, with the goal to transform part of the U.S. facilities to a services platform that can include external commercial or opportunistic computing services, including amazon and High Performance Computing Centers funded by DOE and NSF. For CMS a goal is to gain seamless access to on-demand computing resources for fast-turnaround data processing. 

Preparing for the run, the deployment of multi-core jobs running multi-threaded applications made good progress.  A major version of the experiment software (CMSSW) was released, which is targeted at 2016 data taking and supports multi-threading and many other features.  The R&D area continues activities that have made immediate impacts on operations and also prepare the computing systems for the longer term.

The spending plan for 2016 was developed with input from a series of budget reviews in the fall of last year, input from the Resource Allocation Advisory Board RAAB, and discussions with the funding agencies and the Joint Oversight Group JOG. Funding levels for 2016 are low compared to previous years and funding demands for HL-LHC R&D are increasing to prepare for the upgrade project. The U.S. CMS Operations Program is following a tight spending plan, shown in the Resource Manager's report in the next sections, tracking variances and staying within the envelope.

The luminosity expectations for the physics run starting in the coming quarter are for 25/fb, up to 30/fb of data accumulated in the 150 days planned for  $pp$ luminosity running. This represents a large increase in available luminosity for CMS at 13 TeV, and the outlook for potential discoveries are exciting!
