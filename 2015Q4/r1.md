# Program Manager's Summary

During this third quarter of **calendar year 2015** (2015Q3) CMS was starting physics data taking at increasing LHC luminosities. 

During this quarter, the last quarter of  **calendar year 2015**, the LHC completed its proton-proton physics run for the year, and after a set-up period collided heavy ions for a month, and finally entered a year-end shutdown with no data taking. 

During the last quarter of 2015, the LHC completed proton-proton for the year, collided heavy ions for a month, and then entered a year-end shutdown with no data taking. 


In November the run was turned over to the Heavy Ion physics program.  There was an initial reference proton collision run at $\sqrt{s}=5$ TeV followed by lead-lead collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5$ TeV/nucleon.  There were 29.5/pb of reference proton collisions delivered, of which 27.9/pb were recorded.  Similarly, there were 0.60/nb of lead-lead collisions delivered, of which 0.56/nb were recorded. 


On December 15, at the so-called "Data Jamoboree", the CMS experiment presented 33 different physics results from the 13 TeV data.   This is a testament to operational performance of the detector, and the success of 
all the operations tasks that are required to get from data to physics objects with which analysis can be performed.
