# Program Manager's Summary

During this quarter, the last quarter of *calendar year 2015*, the LHC completed its first running period in Run 2. The initial proton-proton physics run was completed, and after a set-up period, LHC collided heavy ions for a month. In mid December the LHC entered a "year end technical stop" (YETS) period with no beams in the machine, giving opportunity for repairs in the experiment areas. 

During the run CMS data taking efficiency was high at an overall 90%.  The total luminosity recorded in CMS during stable beams with $p-p$ collisions at 13 TeV center-of-mass energy was 3.81/fb.  This number includes approximately 0.40/fb of data taken with the magnetic field off or below nominal value due to the problems with the magnet cryogenic system.

In November the run was turned over to the Heavy Ion physics program.  LHC performed an initial reference proton collision run with 29.5/pb of which CMS recorded 27.9/pb at the nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5 TeV. LHC then delivered 0.60/nb of lead-lead collisions, also at $\sqrt{s}=5$ TeV/nucleon, of which CMS recorded 0.56/nb. 

At the end of the running period, during the HI run, CMS developed a water leak in the endcap muon system (YE+1) that impacted the operation of the detector and ultimately required to switch off power to the on-detector electronic. CMS ran without the whole ME+1 station for the last few days of the heavy ion run, and impact on HI data taking was limited. A search for  leaks and potential damages, as well as repairs are planned for the YETS. This work will impact the already tight schedule of the technical stop in the next quarter, as the CMS heavy elements will need to be opened to perform the repairs.

In the HCAL the scintillator light output is constantly monitored for the effect of radiation damage. The end cap HE signals continued to degrade due to significant radiation effects on scintillator tiles and wavelength-shifting fibers, and this is expected to continue at a rate that is possibly higher than anticipated. Working groups were formed in November to study the damage, assess its physics impact, and to develop mitigation strategies. The groups also look into the possibility of a partial replacement of HE mega-tiles during the Long Shutdown 2 (LS2).

Problems with operating the CMS magnet continued through the quarter. Since March the 'Cold Box' (CB) that liquifies Helium for cooling the CMS superconducting solenoid has shown problems, following an incident where compressor oil contaminated the downstream CB circuits. There are now detailed plans for an overall cleanup to be preformed during next quarter's YETS. The oil separation system which is part of the Helium liquification plant will be replaced with a higher-capacity model, which has been ordered to arrive in time for installation during the YETS. 

During the quarter the performance of the CB continued to be instable leading to insufficient production of liquid cold helium. Pressure-drops increasing over filters and adsorbers used to remove contaminants from the system, and variances in the temperature gradient across heat exchangers allowed to track the performance of the system. Breaks were needed to replacing filters and regeneration of adsobers and heat exchangers in the system, leading to down-times where the magnet could not be adequately cooled and thus had to be witched off. The CERN cryogenics group and CMS Technical Coordination managed to operate the CB with a reasonable duty cycle such that magnet down times could be to some extent synchronized with planned breaks in LHC physics operations. The impact on CMS data taking thus was minimized. 

Thus, despite the ongoing difficulties with operating the CMS magnet, physics data taking was rather successful. Overall it resulted in loss of just about 10% of the total integrated luminosity during the run, and in the end only marginally effected CMS' physics productivity. 

Indeed, at the December 15 ["Data Jamoboree"](https://indico.cern.ch/event/442432/)^[https://indico.cern.ch/event/442432/], the CMS experiment presented 33 different physics results using the data taken at 13 TeV center-of-mass energy.   This is a testament to operational performance of the detector, and the success of all the operations tasks that are required to get from data to physics objects with which analysis can be performed.
