# Program Manager's Summary

During this quarter, the last quarter of  **calendar year 2015** (2015Q4), the LHC completed its proton-proton physics run for the year, and after a set-up period collided heavy ions for a month, and finally entered a year-end shutdown with no data taking. 

During the last quarter of 2015, the LHC completed proton-proton for the year, collided heavy ions for a month, and then entered a year-end shutdown with no data taking. 

The total luminosity recorded in CMS during stable beams with $p-p$ collisions at 13 TeV center-of-mass energy was 3.81/fb, taken with an overall efficiency of 90%, and including approximately 0.40/fb taken with the magnetic field off or below  nominal value due to the problems of the magnet cryo system.

In November the run was turned over to the Heavy Ion physics program.  There was an initial reference proton collision run at $\sqrt{s}=5$ TeV followed by lead-lead collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5$ TeV/nucleon.  There were 29.5/pb of reference proton collisions delivered, of which 27.9/pb were recorded.  Similarly, there were 0.60/nb of lead-lead collisions delivered, of which 0.56/nb were recorded. 

Problems with the CMS magnet continued through the quarter. 

In Run 2, HE signals have continued to degrade due to radiation damage of the scintillator tiles and the wavelength-shifting fibers. As a result, working groups were formed in November to study the effect in detail and prepare for the possibility of a partial replacement of HE megatiles during Long Shutdown 2.

On December 15, at the so-called "Data Jamoboree", the CMS experiment presented 33 different physics results from the 13 TeV data.   This is a testament to operational performance of the detector, and the success of 
all the operations tasks that are required to get from data to physics objects with which analysis can be performed.
