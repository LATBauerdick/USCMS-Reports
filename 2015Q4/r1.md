During this third quarter of **calendar year 2015** (2015Q3) CMS was starting physics data taking at increasing LHC luminosities. 


During the last quarter of 2015, the LHC completed proton-proton for the year, collided heavy ions for a month, and then entered a year-end shutdown with no data taking.
