Much work was done in the software to be ready for that, and to prepare the facilities and infrastructure systems for the processing. &nbsp;The heavy-ion run put particular strains on many aspects of the system, which required fast turnaround on a number of development efforts. &nbsp;These will be useful within the proton program as higher luminosities are reached. &nbsp;And finally, the shutdown allowed all facilities to focus on reprocessing activities. &nbsp;All computing facilities had excellent performance during this period, with a record number of CPU hours delivered by the Fermilab Tier-1 facility (despite a few operational difficulties) and heavy use of the Tier-2 centers. &nbsp;The operations team used these faciilities to deliver many samples that will be needed to present new physics results at the upcoming winter conferences. &nbsp;R&amp;D efforts supported these activities, including the first scale tests of the Fermilab HEPCloud elastic facility, which is expected to have some major achievements during the second quarter.</span></p><h1 class="c2"><a id="h.ufkwr5smmn6f" name="h.ufkwr5smmn6f"></a><span class="c14">Major milestones achieved this quarter</span></h1><a href="#" id="d6be37cf7d6484991c9b2297f3bfcfd25b44f1a3" name="d6be37cf7d6484991c9b2297f3bfcfd25b44f1a3"></a><a href="#" id="0" name="0"></a><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="c13"><tbody><tr class="c8"><td class="c4" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Date</span></p></td><td class="c4" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Milestone</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c8"><td class="c4" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c5">October 2015</span></p></td><td class="c4" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Tier0 2.0.0 released</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c8"><td class="c4" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c5">October 2015</span></p></td><td class="c4" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c5">CMSSW_7_6_0 released with features needed for end-of-year reprocessing </span></p></td></tr><tr class="c8"><td class="c4" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c5">November 2015</span></p></td><td class="c4" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c5">CMSSW_7_5_0 deployed in the Tier-0 facility for HI data taking</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c8"><td class="c4" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c5">November 2015</span></p></td><td class="c4" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Tier 1 FY15 CPU and disk purchases deployed</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c8"><td class="c4" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c5">December 2015</span></p></td><td class="c4" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c5">WMAgent 1.0.12 released</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c8"><td class="c4" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c5">December 2015</span></p></td><td class="c4" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c5">End-of-year reprocessing begins</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h1 class="c2"><a id="h.pdhpagafht8s" name="h.pdhpagafht8s"></a><span class="c14">Fermilab Facilities</span></h1><p class="c6"><span>The 2015 portion of LHC Run 2 completed in the first quarter of the 2016 fiscal year, with the Fermilab facility accepting almost 4 PB of collision and simulated data. &nbsp;Over 8000 cores of additional CPU resources from the FY15 purchase cycle were also deployed this quarter. &nbsp;

This workflow has been possible at Tier-2 sites since May 2015, thanks in part to development work undertaken during the shutdown. &nbsp;These workflows place a heavy strain on the internal networking capabilities of the sites, but the U.S. sites are all able to handle the increased load.

We use the standard CMS production infrastructure to submit workflows to the Fermilab Tier-1, and augment its resources by elastically scaling out to AWS via HEPCloud. During Q1, we successfully achieved first 1% and then 10% scale, i.e. initially 500, and then 5000 cores sustained operations. The 100% scale operations planned for Q2 will produce actual simulation requests at AWS that are necessary for the CMS science program.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span></span></p><h1 class="c2"><a id="h.uxapyt2ia0td" name="h.uxapyt2ia0td"></a><span class="c14">Software and Support</span></h1><h1 class="c2"><a id="h.mbag4saunmef" name="h.mbag4saunmef"></a><span class="c10">In Q1, significant effort went into understanding the detector response to the extra out-of-time pileup at 25 ns bunch spacing relative to the previous running conditions at 50 ns bunch spacing. &nbsp;The knowledge gained was captured in the code and calibrations delivered in the CMSSW 7_6_0 release, which was used to reprocess all of the data collected in 2015.</span></h1><p class="c6"><span>The commissioning of the heavy-ion data taking required many modifications to the CMSSW 7_5_0 release used to acquire the data. &nbsp;Thanks in part to being able to run the heavy-ion HLT and Tier0 applications in multi-threaded mode, the data was collected and processed at unprecedented rates and operations were considered very successful.</span></p><h2 class="c6 c16"><a id="h.dl0sa1s3s7iy" name="h.dl0sa1s3s7iy"></a><span>Technologies and Upgrade R&amp;D</span></h2><p class="c6"><span>The R&amp;D area has continued work on evolving and scaling the CMS computing system, as well as prototyping new technologies for future use.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span></span></p><p class="c6"><span>During this quarter, significant improvements in HTCondor negotiator service were delivered. &nbsp;These improved the speed of the central daemons sufficiently to keep 130k cores occupied and allow the central daemons to limit the number of concurrent jobs that utilize the AAA data federation. &nbsp;Within the &ldquo;global pool,&rdquo; we prototyped and delivered a mechanism for utilizing data federations within the production system (and otherwise reroute jobs to other sites). &nbsp;This was extensively used to run jobs on the CERN HLT over the end-of-year shutdown. &nbsp;To further improve accessibility of data, we have focused on integrating machine learning techniques to predict dataset popularity for initial placement.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span></span></p><p class="c6"><span>Beyond the WLCG facilities, we have maintained the capability to run at DOE supercomputing facilities (namely, NERSC). &nbsp;We have managed the NERSC allocation of 2.5M CPU hours for U.S. CMS. &nbsp;As NERSC is transitioning to new hardware, the focus has been on continued benchmarking via the Docker-like &ldquo;Shifter&rdquo; interface provided by the NERSC team.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span></span></p><p class="c6"><span>On the software side, we have migrated all production and experimental CMSSW architectures to GCC 5.3.0 and a single branch. In this quarter, we were able to get CMSSW functioning on the POWER8 architecture. &nbsp;The ARM work was presented at Linaro Connect SFO 2015 (&quot;ARM64/AArch64 for Scientific Computing at the CERN/CMS Particle Detector&quot;). &nbsp;There has been continuous background activity with Intel on Intel C++ Compiler and CMSSW; a number of issues have been reported, confirmed and resolved for future releases. &nbsp;This will improve our ability to quickly deploy on new platforms, such as the upcoming Xeon Phi KNL.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span></span></p><p class="c6"><span>For the tracking prototype, this quarter has focused on code consolidation and cleanup to establish a baseline as well as a common development platform for different architectures. &nbsp;We are utilizing Intel VTUNE to try and explore and understand the outstanding issues observed with the baseline (with respect to vectorization and parallelization efficiencies).</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span></span></p><p class="c6 c7 c9"><span></span></p></body></html>
