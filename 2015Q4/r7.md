# Software and Computing

During the last quarter of 2015, the LHC completed proton-proton for the year, collided heavy ions for a month, and then entered a year-end shutdown with no data taking. These LHC activities set the agenda for U.S. CMS Software and Computing this quarter. The end of the proton run led to the traditional reprocessing pass for both data and simulation samples. Much work was done in the software to be ready for that, and to prepare the facilities and infrastructure systems for the processing. The heavy-ion run put particular strains on many aspects of the system, which required fast turnaround on a number of development efforts. These will be useful within the proton program as higher luminosities are reached. And finally, the shutdown allowed all facilities to focus on reprocessing activities. All computing facilities had excellent performance during this period, with a record number of CPU hours delivered by the Fermilab Tier-1 facility (despite a few operational difficulties) and heavy use of the Tier-2 centers. The operations team used these facilities to deliver many samples that will be needed to present new physics results at the upcoming winter conferences. R&D efforts supported these activities, including the first scale tests of the Fermilab HEPCloud elastic facility, which is expected to have some major achievements during the second quarter.

Table: Major milestones achieved this quarter

## Fermilab Facilities

The 2015 portion of LHC Run 2 completed in the first quarter of the 2016 fiscal year, with the Fermilab facility accepting almost 4 PB of collision and simulated data.  Over 8000 cores of additional CPU resources from the FY15 purchase cycle were also deployed this quarter. These resources were fully utilized as soon as they were deployed due to the increase in CPU demands by CMS in preparation for winter conferences.

Fermilab site readiness metrics were impacted by the many changes
in deploying these resources.  Two periods of failing metrics are seen
in Figure 1.  The first, in October was due to a controller failure on
one of the older storage nodes, leading to failed test jobs and transfer
failures until recovery.  A second period of failing metrics is seen in
November due to a misconfiguration of the new CPU nodes deployed at that
time.  The misconfiguration primarily affected the test jobs themselves.
Despite these incidents FNAL provided over 33 million successful wall
hours to CMS in the quarter, more than any quarter prior.

Late in this quarter the T1 facility began working toward
upgrading the dCache disk and tape storage pools to the latest supported
version, and transitioning its support to the Data Management Services
department within Fermilab Scientific Computing Division.  That
department also supports the Fermilab public dCache storage and the
lab’s Enstore tape archive (including that for CMS), so this move is
both a consolidation of effort and working toward a service model of
support for CMS.  The 8 PB of disk storage purchased in FY15 is being
used to facilitate this upgrade by providing a separate pool to
thoroughly test the targeted version for the dCache upgrade.

## University Facilities

The first quarter of FY16 saw a continuing increase
in the usage of the U.S. CMS Tier-2 facilities, as seen in
Figure 2. This increase was largely due to running the CMS data
reconstruction at the U.S. Tier-2 sites. This workflow has been possible
at Tier-2 sites since May 2015, thanks in part to development work
undertaken during the shutdown.  These workflows place a heavy strain on
the internal networking capabilities of the sites, but the U.S. sites
are all able to handle the increased load. Physics analysis with CRAB3
and other production activities are also increasing.



The seven U.S. sites have finalized their hardware deployments for
2015 and are planning or actively purchasing hardware for 2016. The
connection of the Tier-2 sites to the LHCONE VPN by ESNet is proceeding
in an orderly manner and should be completed during the current quarter.
All sites have deployed the HTCondor-CE computing element, and over half
of the sites have retired their GRAM CEs. The rest are planning to do so
soon, perhaps in this quarter. The motivation for this transition is
better stability and scalability as well as easier support.



All of the U.S. CMS Tier-2 sites have operated successfully this
quarter. On our two official performance metrics based on CMS test jobs,
all sites were at least 82.5% “<span

 is &gt; 25%), making them seven of the eight most-used Tier-2 sites in
all of global CMS.

CMS workflows at the U.S. CMS Tier-2 sites by month.



Five Tier-3 sites required assistance from the Tier-3 support team
this past quarter.  Most sites have transitioned to OSG 3.2 so support
efforts are primarily focused on helping sites that are rebuilding their
sites (primarily Rice, FSU, and UMD).  TAMU became the first U.S. Tier 3
site to implement the submission for local users via GlideinWMS/CRAB3;
this allows physicists to use the exact same tools for submitting jobs
both to the grid and to local resources.  Support was also provided for
updating PhEDEx parameters and keys.



This quarter, the CMS Connect effort focused on transitioning CMS
Connect from a dedicated GlideinWMS factory hosted at UCSD to the global
CMS ITB factory.  The final software developments required to begin beta
testing have been completed.  Beta testers have been recruited to give
feedback during the current quarter.

## Operations

Operations during Q1 was dominated by three main activities:
finishing up the data processing for the 13 TeV pp run, closing the
CMSSW\_74x DIGI-RECO processing, and processing the 2015 heavy-ion data.
The very end of the quarter was dedicated to the preparation of the
CMSSW\_76x re-reconstruction of all data, which finally got started on
December 18 and ran well throughout the end-of-year break.
In the first quarter of FY16 we have completed 3.6 B
DIGI-RECO events (including some 76x re-reco), 8.9 B GEN-SIM events and
redone 3.9 B MINIAOD and 3.7 B data events re-reconstructed. This is a
substantial increase with respect to the production activity during the
year as shown in Figure 3.

<span class="c15">Figure 3: Production summary for the last
13 months. A steep increase of the production rate in the first quarter
of FY2016 is due to redoing the MINIAOD, the data re-reconstruction, and
the MC re-processing with version 76x.



The Computing Operations project has transitioned into the new
organizational structure of the CMS Offline Software and Computing
project. The ‘Central Services’ and the ‘Facilities and Infrastructure’
groups in Computing Operations have been replaced with a single Liaison
to new level-2 organization ‘Facilities and Services’. A new Computing
Operations group, ‘Tools and Integration’ is being established to better
address the topics of integration of our tools.



## Computing Infrastructure and Services

Q1 came to a close with the LHC heavy-ion running. This was a
challenge for the CMS Tier0, as the facility was pushed beyond its
design limits to maximize the amount of data collected. However, due to
improvements made during the quarter to WMAgent and the Tier0,
particularly performance enhancements and increased robustness of data
publication and injection, the Tier0 performed well under this extreme
load.



Among numerous improvements to WMAgent, the developers added
settings to allow workflows to overflow into opportunistic resources.
Planning has begun for a needed refactoring of WMAgent to better use
resources available for a limited time and to reduce operational effort.
The WMArchive project to store all the performance and monitoring data
as well as provide access to debugging data from WMAgent made good
progress as the principal contributors met several times and determined
their roles and finalized the architecture. 



All projects have finished modernizing their Python code in
preparation for the move to Python3. Enhancements to DBS and WMAgent to
improve the memory performance of the applications went into
production.



Towards our long-term goal of “elastic scale out,” we made
considerable progress in collaboration with the HEPCloud project. We
have an allocation on AWS to establish sustained operations at a level
of 50,000 cores. We use the standard CMS production infrastructure to
submit workflows to the Fermilab Tier-1, and augment its resources by
elastically scaling out to AWS via HEPCloud. During Q1, we successfully
achieved first 1% and then 10% scale, i.e. initially 500, and then 5000
cores sustained operations. The 100% scale operations planned for Q2
will produce actual simulation requests at AWS that are necessary for
the CMS science program.



## Software and Support

During this quarter significant effort went into understanding the detector response to the extra out-of-time pileup at 25 ns bunch spacing relative to the previous running conditions at 50 ns bunch spacing.  The knowledge gained was captured in the code and calibrations delivered in the CMSSW 7\_6\_0 release, which was used to reprocess all of the data collected in 2015. 

The commissioning of the heavy-ion data taking required many
modifications to the CMSSW 7\_5\_0 release used to acquire the data.
 Thanks in part to being able to run the heavy-ion HLT and Tier0
applications in multi-threaded mode, the data was collected and
processed at unprecedented rates and operations were considered very
successful.

## Technologies and Upgrade R&D

The R&D area has continued work on evolving and scaling the CMS
computing system, as well as prototyping new technologies for future
use.



During this quarter, significant improvements in HTCondor
negotiator service were delivered.  These improved the speed of the
central daemons sufficiently to keep 130k cores occupied and allow the
central daemons to limit the number of concurrent jobs that utilize the
AAA data federation.  Within the “global pool,” we prototyped and
delivered a mechanism for utilizing data federations within the
production system (and otherwise reroute jobs to other sites).  This was
extensively used to run jobs on the CERN HLT over the end-of-year
shutdown.  To further improve accessibility of data, we have focused on
integrating machine learning techniques to predict dataset popularity
for initial placement.



Beyond the WLCG facilities, we have maintained the capability to
run at DOE supercomputing facilities (namely, NERSC).  We have managed
the NERSC allocation of 2.5M CPU hours for U.S. CMS.  As NERSC is
transitioning to new hardware, the focus has been on continued
benchmarking via the Docker-like “Shifter” interface provided by the
NERSC team.



On the software side, we have migrated all production and
experimental CMSSW architectures to GCC 5.3.0 and a single branch. In
this quarter, we were able to get CMSSW functioning on the POWER8
architecture.  The ARM work was presented at Linaro Connect SFO 2015
("ARM64/AArch64 for Scientific Computing at the CERN/CMS Particle
Detector").  There has been continuous background activity with Intel on
Intel C++ Compiler and CMSSW; a number of issues have been reported,
confirmed and resolved for future releases.  This will improve our
ability to quickly deploy on new platforms, such as the upcoming Xeon
Phi KNL.



For the tracking prototype, this quarter has focused on code
consolidation and cleanup to establish a baseline as well as a common
development platform for different architectures.  We are utilizing
Intel VTUNE to try and explore and understand the outstanding issues
observed with the baseline (with respect to vectorization and
parallelization efficiencies).
