# Report of the U.S. CMS Resource Manager

The funding provided by DOE and NSF to the U.S.\ CMS Operations Program for 2002
through 2017, as well as the funding guidance for 2018 through 2020, is shown in
Figure {@fig:funding_profile}.  The allocations shown for 2017 and beyond do not include
any funds designated for HL-LHC OPC in the case of DOE or HL-LHC R&D in the case of NSF.

through 2017 the chart shows the actual funding, while for 2018 onward the current
funding guidance is shown.](figures/CY17_Funding_Profile.pdf){#fig:funding_profile}

Resources are distributed and tracked across the three areas through which the
Operations Program is implemented:  Detector Operations (DetOps), Software and
Computing (S&C), and Common Operations (ComOps). ComOps is a category for items that
would otherwise belong in both, or neither, of the other two categories.

Internal budget reviews for calendar year 2017 took place in July and August of 2016.  As an
additional source of input to the planning process, the Resource Allocation Advisory Board met
five times from September through December of 2016, and issued a report of findings and
recommendations.  Through these processes, U.S.\ CMS Management developed a detailed
spending plan, while taking into account updated guidance from the funding agencies.
This plan was further refined through the January 2017 joint NSF/DOE Operations Program
review.

Primarily during the first quarter of the calendar year, Statement of Work (SOW)
agreements were established with each institution that is providing a deliverable in
exchange for Operations Program funding.  The SOWs specify the tasks to be carried out,
as well as any portions of salaries, materials and services (M&S), travel funding, or
cost of living adjustments (COLA) to be paid from the Operations Program budget.  The
SOWs must be approved by U.S.\ CMS Operations Program management, by the Fermilab
Director Designee, and by representatives of the collaborating group and institution.
Through September of 2017, a total of 78 SOWs (54 DOE and 24 NSF) were produced and
approved.  After a SOW is approved, any additional changes are considered and,
if approved, enacted through a Change Request procedure.

Figure {@fig:change_log} shows the Spending Plan Change Log which captures revisions
that were made prior to SOW approvals, as well as modifications implemented through
Change Requests.  The information is reported here down to the level-2 subsystem
categories within DetOps, S&C, and ComOps.  The CY17 spending plan, as of the end of Q3,
is shown for DOE and NSF funds in Figure {@fig:spending_plan}.

Once funds have been committed through purchase orders, in the
case of DOE, and sub-awards, in the case of NSF, they are considered obligated.
Figure {@fig:DOE_obligations} shows the obligations in the areas of DetOps, S&C, and
ComOps, as compared to the spending plan, for DOE funds.  The spending plan is plotted
as if expenditures are carried out in even allocations each month, but this is
intentionally not the case due to equipment purchases and the larger of the transfers
to CERN-based Team Accounts, the latter of which are targeted for when exchange rates
are favorable.  Spending through Universities and CERN Team Accounts is budgeted and
tracked according to the calendar year.  Spending at Fermilab has historically been
budgeted according to the fiscal year, however this is the third year that we are
reporting all activities based on calendar year.  Figure {@fig:NSF_obligations} shows
the total obligations and the spending plan, for NSF funds.  Of the $8.1M in NSF
funding, $2.6M in subawards went out this quarter, in addition to spending
directly at Princeton.

the assumption of equal monthly increments just as a rough guide.](figures/CY17Q3_DOE_Obligations.pdf){#fig:DOE_obligations}

Resources deployed at CERN, and paid directly in Swiss francs, account for approximately
27% of the 2017 spending plan.  This carries considerable exposure to the exchange rate.
A rate of 0.9 CHF/USD has been used for planning, while the actual rate in CY17 Q3
averaged 0.96 CHF/USD.  Figure {@fig:Team_Accounts} shows the allocated budgets and
year-to-date spending through the Team Accounts that are used for expenditures at CERN.
Spending for labor and cost of living adjustments occurs at a fairly constant rate.
Figure {@fig:Team_Accounts} does not include the 3,668K CHF M&O-A payments, as these
are made through multiple payments to a separate Team Account.

A Risk Management Plan is being implemented for the U.S.\ CMS Operations Program,
with many aspects drawn from the Fermilab Risk Management Plan.  A Risk Register is updated
quarterly, according to the workflow described in the following subsection.  At the start of
the quarter, the Risk Register contained 31 open risks spread across the program.
At the end of the quarter, there were 33 risks, with threats summing to $8.0M and opportunities
summing to $0.5M.  Figure {@fig:Risk_Summary} shows the top few risks at the end of the
quarter, ranked by *Probability* $\times$ *Cost Impact*, as well as risks added, realized, and
retired this quarter.

as well as risks that were added, realized, and retired this quarter.](figures/CY17Q3_Risk_Summary.pdf){#fig:Risk_Summary}

## Workflow for Risk Management Plan

The following procedures have been put in place to carry out the workflow for the U.S.\ CMS Operations Program Risk
Management Plan.  The workflow is divide into two paths:  (1) updates that are made at any time, and (2) a review
of risks once per quarter.  In all of the following, *updates* mean adding new risks, realizing risks, retiring old risks,
or modifying existing risks.  In all cases, it is the program office team that edits the Risk Register.  The following descriptions
are also summarized in Figure {@fig:Risk_Workflow}.

### (1) At any time:

Any member of the management team (including Program Manager, Deputy Program Manager, L1 Managers, L2 Managers,
Resource Manager, and program office lead) shall alert the program office of any updates.  The program office informs
the corresponding L1 manager, and the L1 manager approves, rejects, or modifies the proposed updates.  This can also
involve iterating with the L2 manager.  If updates are accepted, the management team reviews the risk mitigations and
risk responses that are associated with the updates.  The management team takes into account the risk rank and/or position
in the risk rank matrix and takes any necessary pre-emptive actions to incorporate mitigation activities into the plan.
If appropriate (again factoring in the probability and impact of the risk), the operations program plan is also adjusted
to account for the estimated resources required to execute the risk responses related to the updated risks.

### (2) Once per quarter:

Within one month prior to the end of each quarter, the program office lead asks the L2 managers whether they have any
updates to the risks in their L2 area.  The program office then informs the corresponding L1 manager of any such updates,
and the L1 manager approves, rejects, or modifies the proposed updates.  As above, this can involve iterating with the L2
manager.  As part of the quarterly workflow, the management team reviews *all* of the current risks, and takes any necessary
actions and adjusts the program plan if appropriate.
