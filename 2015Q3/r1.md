# Program Manager's Summary

Resource Allocation Advisory Board
▪ The Operations Program (OP) managers and the Phase2 upgrade manager are creating a Resource Allocation Advisory Board (RAAB) and charging it to provide advice on questions regarding the allocation of funds between the different activity areas of the OP, and on the interplay between the planned Phase2 upgrade projects, including enabling R&D and pre-construction planning, and the OP.
▪ The RAAB is asked to review the longer-term needs and cost estimates, the impact of the cuts in computing upgrades, and the tight management reserve and carry-over allocations in the current plan. It should provide a recommendation for the balance of OP vs. Phase2 upgrade allocations, in particular for 2016, in view of the longer term needs and spending plan for the years beyond, and based on the current understanding of scope and costs, institutional roles and responsibilities, and time lines.
▪ The RAAB should get organized immediately and work with the OP and the upgrade project management teams to provide a recommendation in time for the 2016 budget process, that is at the end of July 2015
