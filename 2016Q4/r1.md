On the U.S. collaboration side, two new institutions are becoming CMS members this year. Catholic University of America/A.Dominguez, member since Sep.
▪ Simons Institute for Computational Science/I.Fisk applied in Sep   CB decision
in Nov


2017 U.S. fraction in CMS   remains almost  
exactly constant
▪ as measured in   PhD physicists
 DOE 308 (22%)  NSF 75 (5.4%)  Nuclear 27 (2%)  Others 11 (0.8%)
▪ GrandTotal:  
U.S. 421 of 1403   (or 30.0%)







▪ Challenging shutdown work ahead with risks for being fully operational with
restart of LHC in May/June 2017
▪ significant additional resources for detector operations: technicians for
installation, firmware and software engineers for readout, monitoring,
commissioning, calibration etc
▪ Budget is very stretched, and any possible reserve is used up
▪ given the multi-million dip in Ops funding and the need for HL-LHC R&D
funding, we had to bring down ops and S&C to a unprecedented minimum, much below
Run1 level
▪ Poses risks to aging detector (HCAL scintillators, CSCs etc), and currently no
funding identified for any possible detector improvement program before LS3
