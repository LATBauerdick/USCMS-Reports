The funding provided by DOE and NSF to the U.S.\ CMS Operations Program
for 2002 through 2015, as well as the funding guidance for 2016 through 2019,
is shown in Figure\ \ref{fig:funding_profile}.

Resources are distributed and tracked across the three areas of the program:  Detector Operations (DetOps),
Software and Computing (S\&C), and Common Operations (ComOps).
ComOps is a category for items that would otherwise belong in both, or
neither, of the other two categories.

Internal budget reviews for the current calendar year took place this
past August and September.  Through this process, U.S.\ CMS Management
developed a detailed spending plan for 2015 and beyond. 
This plan was further refined
through the March 2015 joint NSF/DOE Operations Program review.

Primarily during this first quarter of the calendar year Statement of Work (SOW) agreements were established with each institution that is providing a deliverable in exchange for Operations Program funding. The SOWs specify the tasks to be carried out, as well as any portions of salaries, materials and services (M\&S), travel funding, or cost of living adjustments (COLA) to be paid from the Operations Program budget. The SOWs must be approved by U.S.\ CMS Operations Program management, by the Fermilab Director Designee overseeing the program, and by representatives of the collaborating group and institution. Through March of 2015, a total of 86 SOWs (54 DOE and 32 NSF) were produced and approved.  After a SOW is approved, any additional changes are considered and, if approved, enacted through a Change Request procedure.

Table\ \ref{tab:change_log} shows the Spending Plan Change Log which captures revisions that were made prior to SOW approvals, as well as modifications implemented through Program Change Requests.  The information is reported here down to the level-2 subsystem categories within DetOps, S\&C, and ComOps. 

The changes in the spending plan for Phase 2 Upgrade R&D during this quarter deserve a special note. The 2015 spending plan foresees to hold back \$500k of funding eventually to be allocated to Phase 2 Upgrade R&D, the exact allocation to be decided upon after the CMS endcap calorimeter upgrade technology decision is made later this year. This is shown in the table as "Reduction, to be re-allocated after EC downselect". There was also an increase of \$207,847 spread across several sub-areas of Phase 2 Upgrade R&D, involving eight institutions.

The spending plan is going over Calendar Years (CY), and for 2015 it is shown for DOE and NSF funds in Table\ \ref{tab:spending_plan}.  The plan will continue to evolve slightly as the remaining SOWs are being approved over the following quarter, and as Change Requests are executed. For the allocation of resources among the seven S\&C WBS tasks indicated in both Table\ \ref{tab:change_log} and Table\ \ref{tab:spending_plan}, small differences with respect to what was shown at the most recent Joint Oversight Group meeting are due to a more precise attribution of the travel, COLA, and M\&S costs to each of the S\&C WBS tasks.

Once funds have been committed, through purchase orders at Fermilab in the case of DOE, and
through university sub-awards at Princeton in the case of NSF, 
they are considered obligated for the purpose of this report.
Figure\ \ref{fig:DOE_obligations} shows the obligations in the areas of DetOps,
S\&C, and ComOps, as compared to the spending plan, for DOE funds.  The spending
plan is plotted as if expenditures are carried out in even allocations each month, to facilitate the graphic representation of expected spending over the year. In reality, by intention, this is not the case due to equipment purchases and the larger funding transfers to CERN-based
Team Accounts, the latter of which are usually made when exchange rates are favorable.

Spending through Universities and CERN Team Accounts is allocated and tracked according to the calendar year following the yearly spending plans that are based on calendar years of performance, while spending at Fermilab is budgeted according to the fiscal year.  Of special note is that with this quarterly report we transition to reporting based on calendar year to align reporting with the annual spending plans as reviewed by the funding agencies, which are done in calendar year (CY).

There are two features of Figure\ \ref{fig:DOE_obligations} related to this transition. First, obligations for DOE spending at Fermilab in the last three months of CY 2014 have been included in the plotted obligations for 2015.  Second, to accommodate the three month offset between fiscal year and calendar year, a buffer of \$3M has been allocated this year, drawing from carry over from previous years.  This is indicated by the difference between the solid and dashed blue lines.  Figure\ \ref{fig:NSF_obligations} shows the total obligations and the spending plan, for NSF funds.  Of the \$9M in NSF funding, a first installment of \$6M arrived during this quarter.  In addition to spending at Princeton, which hosts the NSF cooperative agreement, only one subaward went out this quarter.  Obligations of NSF funds will increase substantially in the next quarter as the bulk of the subawards are issued.

Resources deployed at CERN, and paid directly in Swiss francs, account for approximately 28\% of the 2015 spending plan.  This carries considerable exposure to the exchange rate. A rate of 0.9 CHF/USD has been used for planning, while the actual rate this quarter averaged at 0.95 CHF/USD.  Figure\ \ref{fig:Team_Accounts} shows the allocated budgets and year-to-date spending through the Team Accounts that are used for expenditures at CERN.  Spending for labor and cost of living adjustments occurs at a fairly constant rate.  Figure\ \ref{fig:Team_Accounts} does not include the last 615K CHF of the Upgrade Common Fund payments (paid in February) and the M\&O-A payments (3,827K CHF, to be paid in three installments later this year), as these are discrete payments to a separate Team Account.
