# Report of the U.S. CMS Resource Manager

The funding provided by DOE and NSF to the U.S.\ CMS Operations Program for 2002 through 2016, as well as the funding guidance for 2017 through 2019, is shown in Figure {@fig:funding_profile}.

![The annual U.S.\ CMS Operations Program funding provided by DOE and NSF.  For 2002 through 2016 the chart shows the actual funding, while for 2017 onward the current funding guidance is shown.  This figure does not include the $1M NSF supplement provided in 2016 specifically for Phase2 Upgrade R&D.](figures/CY16_Funding_Profile.pdf){#fig:funding_profile}

Resources are distributed and tracked across the three areas through which the Operations Program is implemented:  Detector Operations (DetOps), Software and Computing (S&C), and Common Operations (ComOps). ComOps is a category for items that would otherwise belong in both, or neither, of the other two categories.

Internal budget reviews for calendar year 2016 took place in September of 2015.  As a new source of input to the planning process, the Resource Allocation Advisory Board met 19 times from June through November, and issued a report of findings and recommendations.  Through these processes, U.S.\ CMS Management developed a detailed spending plan, while taking into account updated guidance from the funding agencies.

Primarily during the first quarter of the calendar year, Statement of Work (SOW) agreements were established with each institution that is providing a deliverable in exchange for Operations Program funding.  The SOWs specify the tasks to be carried out, as well as any portions of salaries, materials and services (M&S), travel funding, or cost of living adjustments (COLA) to be paid from the Operations Program budget.  The SOWs must be approved by U.S.\ CMS Operations Program management, by the Fermilab Director Designee, and by representatives of the collaborating group and institution.  Through September of 2016, a total of 131 SOWs (82 DOE and 49 NSF) were produced and approved.  After a SOW is approved, any additional changes are considered and, if approved, enacted through a Change Request procedure.

Table {@fig:change_log} shows the Spending Plan Change Log which captures revisions that were made prior to SOW approvals, as well as modifications implemented through Change Requests.  The information is reported here down to the level-2 subsystem categories within DetOps, S&C, and ComOps.  The changes to the Phase2 Upgrade R&D spending plan during this quarter include the allocation of the $1M supplement that has been provided through NSF specifically for Phase2 Upgrade R&D.  The CY16 spending plan, as of the end of Q3, is shown for DOE and NSF funds in Table {@fig:spending_plan}.  The plan will continue to evolve slightly as Change Requests are executed.

Once funds have been committed through purchase orders, in the case of DOE, and sub-awards, in the case of NSF, they are considered obligated.  Figure {@fig:DOE_obligations} shows the obligations in the areas of DetOps, S&C, and ComOps, as compared to the spending plan, for DOE funds.  The spending plan is plotted as if expenditures are carried out in even allocations each month, but this is intentionally not the case due to equipment purchases and the larger of the transfers to CERN-based Team Accounts, the latter of which are targeted for when exchange rates are favorable.  Spending through Universities and CERN Team Accounts is budgeted and tracked according to the calendar year.  Spending at Fermilab has historically been budgeted according to the fiscal year, however this is the second year that we are reporting all activities based on calendar year.  Figure {@fig:NSF_obligations} shows the total obligations and the spending plan, for NSF funds.  Of the $9M in NSF funding (plus $1M Phase2 R&D supplement), $875k in subawards went out this quarter, in addition to spending directly at Princeton.

Resources deployed at CERN and paid directly in Swiss francs account for approximately 27% of the 2016 spending plan.  This carries considerable exposure to the exchange rate.  A rate of 0.9 CHF/USD has been used for planning, while the actual rate in CY16 Q3 averaged 0.98 CHF/USD.  Figure {@fig:Team_Accounts} shows the allocated budgets and year-to-date spending through the Team Accounts that are used for expenditures at CERN.  Spending for labor and cost of living adjustments occurs at a fairly constant rate.  Figure {@fig:Team_Accounts} does not include the 3,756K CHF M&O-A payments, as these are each made through multiple payments to a separate Team Account.
