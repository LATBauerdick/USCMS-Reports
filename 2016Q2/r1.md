# Program Manager's Summary

During this quarter, the second quarter of  **calendar year 2016** (2016Q2), 


Resources deployed at CERN, and paid directly in Swiss francs, account for approximately 27% of the 2016 spending plan. Large bills in Swiss francs were covered during this period, at exchange rates of 0.97 CHF/USD which led to cost savings over the rate of 0.9 CHF/USD used for planning. This allowed project management to respond to additional needs in particular for detector operations, through the mechanism of change requests. Details can be found in the tables in the Resource Manager's report in the next section.
