# Program Manager's Summary

During the first quarter of 2015 the LHC Long Shutdown 1 (LS1) continued with an expectation of start of LHC beam operations in the next quarter. The LHC machine group continued the program of repairs of splices and other magnet components to allow the LHC to eventually reach its design energy of 14 TeV, with 13 TeV as this year's energy target.

CMS has been busy with a variety of activities during the shutdown that are described in the subsystem sections below. CMS worked to complete an extensive detector improvement program with a number of deliverables being installed and commissioned during this quarter, and continued a program of work in software and computing to prepare the startup of CMS data taking at the end of the coming quarter.

In January 2015 there have been changes in the management team for the U.S. CMS Operations Program (see Figure  \ref{pm-fig1} for the updated Org Chart). The new Program Manager is Lothar Bauerdick from Fermilab. Dan Marlow of Princeton University continues as the Deputy Program Manager. Ken Bloom of U.Nebraska was appointed Software and Computing (S&C) Manager, and Liz Sexton-Kennedy of Fermilab was appointed deputy for S&C. The new Detector Operations Manager is Paul Padley of Rice U., replacing Vivian Oâ€™Dell (Fermilab) who was appointed to be U.S. CMS Phase-2 Upgrade Manager, and Max Chertok of UC Davis is overseeing the Phase-2 Upgrade R&D Area. There are two new positions in the Operations Program Management Team, with Aron Soha (Fermilab) being appointed Resource Manager and Greg Rakness (Fermilab) being the Liaison with CMS Run Coordination responsible for the day-by-day data taking and operations of the detector.

## Summary of CMS Activities During this Quarter

CMS is engaged in five major activities: preparation of improvements and repairs to the detector for the run starting this year;  preparation of the detector, operations, computing, offline, data quality monitoring, trigger and physics simulations for the run starting in 2015; construction of the Phase 1 Upgrades; simulation studies, R&D and preparing a Technical Proposal for the Phase 2 Upgrades; and physics analysis of the data from the 2012 run. Each of these tasks has led to important activities and milestones during this quarter.

Regarding improvements and repairs to the detector, CMS completed its shutdown activities, and closed up the detector. A number of milestones and deliverables are listed below in this report. 

The pixel luminosity telescope is now completely installed inside the CMS detector, and its functionality has been tested. The tracker profited from cosmic ray running with magnetic field on and off, and calibrations were performed for the Barrel and Forward Pixel detectors. All parts of ECAL are participating in global runs, following the migration to the new central DAQ and TCDS systems, and the recommissioning of the electron/photon trigger path is proceeding well. Significant HCAL development effort resulted in code for the HCAL local reconstruction for LHC operation with 25ns bunch spacing, including proper out-of-time pile-up subtraction, both for offline and the HLT. The Endcap Muon system  participated smoothly in cosmic global runs throughout this period, and only a few remaining firmware and software issues were being worked on. The spatial resolution for each chamber type was evaluated using cosmics data and was found essentially unchanged from Run 1. The updated DAQ system, including the new Storage Manager Disk system and the new Trigger Control and Distribution System (TCDS) is ready for use in its basic functionality. Focus was on handling of edge cases, improving the monitoring and performance, and interfacing to the event display etc on the offline side. Work on the regional calorimeter trigger (RCT) and the endcap muon trigger continued with the system being ready for cosmic ray triggering, and significant progress was made timing-in the various elements of the triggers.

CMS got ready to begin data taking, starting with cosmic ray data to commission the experiment.  In March this included running with the detector solenoid at 3.8 Tesla.  At the end of the quarter the experiment was ready to continue commissioning with beams to prepare for physics running.

Computing Operations teams have been deeply involved in scale testing of processing at the Tier-0 facility and of data movements to Tier-1 facilities, along with processing of important Monte Carlo samples for both the coming run and the Phase 2 Upgrades studies. The U.S. computing facilities, at the Tier-1 and the Tier-2 centers, have deployed their full complement of computing resources -- processing, disk and tape -- by the April 1st start of the WLCG "Resource Year".  All facilities have maintained high levels of availability and continued to evolve their systems to make use of new capabilities in areas such as multi-core job processing and wide-area network bandwidth expansions. The Software and Services team continued to deploy new features in support of both of analyzing existing data and for the upcoming running period. Important deliverables included the production release of the CRAB3 analysis job submission system, and efforts to make use of additional resources at DOE-ASCR high-performance computing facilities and from commercial computing cloud providers, as part of a strategy to add resources to the computing infrastructure more dynamically.

Transatlantic networking capabilities were transferred from U.S. LHCNet to the ESnet EEX service, and U.S. LCHnet officially ended its service in February. With the transition successfully completed at the beginning of the year, the U.S. LHCnet group's remaining activity was to decommission the services and related hardware installation, and to transitioning to a development oriented configuration leveraging the existing Brocade, Pronto and Dell/Force10 switches for future R&D work outside of the LHC Operations Program. 

With the Phase 1 Upgrade project having entered its construction phase, coordination between the Operations Program and the Upgrade Project management teams continued and it has been a priority in particular to coordinate resources between the Operations Program (including Phase 2 R&D) and the Phase 1 Upgrade Project. A detailed analysis of resources across the U.S. groups both for operations and for Phase 1 Upgrades was shown at the March review. No major issues were identified and small overlaps were corrected. The result is an excellent understanding of the personnel resource plans between Operations Program and Upgrade Project.

The R&D program for the CMS Phase 2 Upgrades was continuing during this quarter. The spending plan for R&D funds for 2015 amounts to about $3.5M. The plan is implemented such that $500k are left for later allocation, after the choice of technology for the endcap calorimeter upgrade, which is expected for the next quarter. This will allow to direct funds to additional R&D efforts for the chosen endcap calorimeter technology, once it is known. Strategic planning for the CMS Phase 2 Upgrades for high luminosity LHC operations was moving forward. U.S. groups worked towards completing the Technical Proposal for the Phase 2 upgrades in the coming quarter, to be reviewed by the LHCC in time for the fall RRB. A number of workshops and meetings were held in the U.S. to plan for the Phase 2 upgrades and to engage U.S. groups in the R&D required for the technical design and before start of construction of the upgrades.

The analysis of data taken in 2011 (5 fb$^{-1}$ at 7 TeV) and 2012 (20 fb$^{-1}$ at 8 TeV) continued during this quarter.  By the end of
the quarter, CMS had submitted some 375 papers for publication. 

To summarize, during this quarter U.S. CMS made significant progress in all five fronts listed above. In the coming quarter we expect to finalize the commissioning of the CMS detector systems for the LHC startup in June 2015, complete the down-select process for the endcap calorimeter upgrades choice and submit the Phase 2 Upgrade technical proposal.
